# Sofascore_scraper
An easy way to collect football data from [Sofascore](www.sofascore.com) thanks to [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io)

# Premier scraper.py
NOT WORKING!
This script will create a csv file with Premier league matches links from 01/02 to 17/18 edition. You must to use this csv file (called hrefs.csv) in the next script.

I'm providing you 2 csv files with match Urls from Premier League 17/18 and 16/17.

# Game scraper.py
The most important part of this work. This script will collect data about player performance (in italian, but I'll change the language).
